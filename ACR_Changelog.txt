- Modified Lets. Get. PAGAN! to include heresies.
-- Georgians and Armenians become Promethian.

- Fixed issue in the event where a son or brother asks to join the red dragons where the buttons would be labeled backwards.
- Galloway is no longer a holy site. Dijon takes its place. This is to represent the Fountains of Sequana, a major place of worship for the Continental Celts. Also to make reformation a little harder. It was way too easy to start as Gwynned and take Dublin and Galloway and do some raiding to get up MA.
- Fixed an issue caused by a Druidic training event calling a Sons of Gwydion event.
- The Wolf Tails will still form if you somehow manage to Reform Celtic before converting even a single province.

Hellenic:
- New Hellenic revival event chain inspired by Michael Psellos and Plethon.
-- Byzantine or Roman Empire must be at 100 or fewer realm holdings, be held by a non-pagan, cannot already have the philosopher in their court, and the current ruler must not have had the event happen to them already.
-- A Philosopher from the University of Constantinople will seek to join your court and provide you with his advice.
-- Over the course of several years, the Philosophos will cause controversy and will require your support. This will come with a price.
- Three traits; Stoic, Skeptic, and Epicurean have been added. The Philosopher will come with the Stoic trait, but it is otherwise only available with Ruler Designer (for now). Skeptic and Epicurean do not yet have icons.
- Added a Hellenic revival event chain if the Mani Peninsula (Monemvasia) is in the realm, as an homage to the 30 pages thread about that on the forum.

Promethean:
- Promethean holy sites have been moved around to better reflect the lore and to differentiate them from Hellenism and the Titans.

-- Consenza; Former site of a Pythagorean Academy, and must be rebuilt (via decision, like the Restore Luxor chain, but different).
-- Kartli; Kartli covers the southern slopes of Mt Kazbek, the legendary peak where Prometheus was chained on the orders of Zeus.
-- Thessalonike; Common holy site for Hellenic and Promethean, to create conflict.
-- Athens; Site of the First Academy and point of conflict between Titan Cultists and Hellenes.

- Prometheans can Rebuild the Academy of Crotone, the site of an ancient Pythagorean academy.
-- +20% MA for Prometheanism for 30 years.
- Prometheans can Organize the Men of Steel, a Holy Order of the faith. The culture of the holy order matches the organizer.
- There is now an Unbinding Festival decision and event chain that Prometheans can do once a year. It is a celebration of the Unbinding of Prometheus from his prison on Mt Kazbek.
-- The event chain includes lots of small random events inspired by vanilla and VIET.
-- If you're lucky you may get a skilled courtier. If you are unlucky, you may be injured, or even die!
- Prometheans now have access to an invasion CB called Expansion. It is inspired partially by Plato's Republic.
-- Conquered provinces suffer from a "Depopulated" modifier for 30 years after the invasion, making it difficult to hold but more likely to convert culture and religion to the top liege.
-- It targets Kingdoms and is based on the tribal invasion cb.

- New Minor Titles: Proxenos, Hellanodikos, Archopapyri (Master of Scrolls), Archothisavrous (Master of Treasures), Fylakasflogas (Keeper of the Flame).

Titan Cult:
- Titan holy sites have been moved around to differentiate them from Hellenism and Prometheanism and better reflect locations that would actually be holy to them.
-- Rome; because of the large temple to Saturn/Kronos.
-- Antioch; because of a mosaic of/dedicated to Tethys. Also it spreads the sites out.
-- Athens; Location of the Kronia festival and point of conflict with Prometheans and Hellenes.
-- Thessalia; location of Mt Othrys, the Titan capitol during the Titanomachy (basically the Titan Olympus).
-- Rhodes; Once held the Colossus, a massive statue to the titan Helios.
- The Sickles are a holy order that can be created by Titan Cultists. The culture of the holy order matches the organizer.
- New Minor Titles: Fylakasminos (Keeper of the Flock), Hellanodikos, Konistrachos (Master of the Arena).

Kemetic:

- Numerous flavor events for Egyptian and Aten pagans, also courtesy of cybrxkhan.
-- Events involving cat worship, palm trees, and keeping the principle of Ma'at in your heart.
- Sed Festival back to requiring a 30 year reign to use.
-- This is more historical and matches the fairly significant boons rewarded. The previous reduction to 10 years was to counteract the lack of flavorful events and decisions available to Kemetic and Atenic characters.
- Coptic culture is available through ruler designer and the console.
-- Coptics have access to a Khopesh wielding heavy infantry/horse archer retinue called the Anhuri.
-- Coptics also can build a Temple of Anhur building to enhance your heavy infantry troops.
- New Minor Titles: Gods Wife, Divine Adoratrice, Master of Palms, Fanbearer on the Right Hand of the King, Iry-pat, Haty-a, Khetemty.

Atenic:
- Faithful followers of Aten can now restore Akhetaten, the ancient city we call Amarna today.
-- This decision is almost a carbon copy of the Restore Luxor decision. It may receive more love in the future.
- Atenism now has a religious head, the Meryaten, which is a King tier Fylkir style title held by the reformer.
-- The Meryaten is created by decision, and requires that Akhetaten is restored.
- The Burning Blades are a new holy order for Atenism that can be created via decision and are immediately vassalized by the organizer.
- Atenic now uses Decadence. If the representitive of the divine on Earth behaves in a manner unworthy of the divine, the people will rise up to overthrow the unworthy in the name of Aten.
- New Minor Titles: Gods Wife, Divine Adoratrice, Master of Palms, Fanbearer on the Right Hand of the King, Iry-pat, Haty-a, Khetemty.

-------------------------
Celtic Paganism:

- Court Druid and Bard minor titles no longer restricted by government type. Any ruler (that matches other requirements) can hire them.
- Court Bards can no longer be landed. If they are busy administering their own land, how can they have time being your bard all day?
- Restless Sidhe is about 40% less likely to occur, and if you've had a good sacrifice to the Sidhe recently it won't happen.
-- Also descreased the mtth for the "sidhe are calmed" event, which requires you have at least a neutral response to your sacrifice. Should be far less annoying for those of you with a demense larger than 4 now ;)
- Fixed localization problems in the Sidhe events that mistakenly referenced the religion of the province, instead of the ruler. This meant that a Celtic Pagan may occassinonaly say "May the Blessed Virgin protect us!".
- Adjusted the Potential on Invite Court Druid and Organize Fianna so it stops cluttering up your menu when its irrelevant. You now must either be a Irish cultured or personally hold land in Ireland to see it (in addition to being Celtic Pagan or Druidic).

- Fixed some localization that was gender specific. These will continue to crop up as we find them.

Hellenic:

- Fixed adopt feudalism and republicanism decisions
- Removed FRENCH, SPANISH and GERMAN used as localization for non-translated keys: the game now properly defaults to English when a key is not translated in another language and playing in that language.

-- Prometheans are pre-reformed and have a creatable head of religion, the Scholarch of the First Academy

The Invite Druid to Court decision fires an event 3 days after you make the decision. So long as you don't have a Court Druid (minor title) you can make the decision. Also, all Celtic Pagan/Druidic Theocracies are automatically given the Druid trait.
- Fixed religion description localization for Celtic Pagan, Druidic, and Hellenic.


2015-01-21 v0.35.3 "Error Free!"

According to the Validator anyway!

- Added localization for several dozen titles, modifiers, and events.
- Added new god names for Kemetic pagans.
- You should now be able to (successfully) look up to your favorite hero of the Trojan War as a hellenic pagan. Unless your favorite hero isn't Achilles, Odysseus, Nestor, Hector, Aeneas, or Paris. Minor thematically appropriate benefits incurred.

This release marks a second life for Ancient Religions. With superskierpat having moved on to higher education, others take up the charge of maintaining and expanding the work of their predecessor.
Now, enough with the dramatics, time for details!

- Dozens of minor fixes from bad event triggers to localization. So many I can't even count them!
- A major reorganization of the files to make com-patches much easier in the future!
- Druidic pagans now have 2 holy orders and 2 mercenary companies!
- The Fianna have had several of their events fixed, expect a visit from the boisterous warriors if you are a Druid and a Gael (Irish or Scottish)! As before, they are created by the King (or Queen!) of Ireland, and can also be vassalized by said monarch, but it is costly. Young men in your realm may wish to join the Fianna, seeking fame and glory.
- The Sons of Gwydion. A mercenary company much like the Varangians, they are organized by, and serve, the Reformed Druidic Emperor of Prydain. They will have a slew of flavor events (most of which are cribbed from the Varangian events). Like the Fianna, your sons may wish to join the Sons of Gwydion.
- The Red Dragon Knights may be formed by any Reformed Druidic King level ruler. They operate like any other Holy Order. They can take donations, give out loans, and will occasionally ask druidic rulers in the de jure empires of Britain, Francia, Hispania, or Germania for permission to build a barony in their lands.
- Finally, The Wolf Tails are a mercenary company that will form spontaneously shortly after the first province converts to Druidic pagan (un-reformed). (The Wolf Tails and the Fianna will both convert when Celtic Paganism reforms.)
- Kemetic (Egyptian Pagan) has been ported over from CK2+ (thanks guys!) and is available if you have Ruler Designer. Currently there are no revival events implemented, but they are planned for v0.40!
- Refactored mod to use ACR_ prefix on txt/csv files and ACR sub-folders for assets, to ease-up mod integration
