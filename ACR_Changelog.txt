2015-3-10 v0.36.2 "Anchises"
-------------------------
Celtic Paganism:
- Wolf, Learning Druidic Arts, and Fennid traits have had their fertility moddifiers reduced by a factor of 100.
- Court Druid and Bard minor titles no longer restricted by government type. Any ruler (that matches other requirements) can hire them.
- Court Bards can no longer be landed. If they are busy administering their own land, how can they have time being your bard all day?
- Restless Sidhe is about 40% less likely to occur, and if you've had a good sacrifice to the Sidhe recently it won't happen.
-- Also descreased the mtth for the "sidhe are calmed" event, which requires you have at least a neutral response to your sacrifice. Should be far less annoying for those of you with a demense larger than 4 now ;)
- Fixed localization problems in the Sidhe events that mistakenly referenced the religion of the province, instead of the ruler. This meant that a Celtic Pagan may occassinonaly say "May the Blessed Virgin protect us!".
- Adjusted the Potential on Invite Court Druid and Organize Fianna so it stops cluttering up your menu when its irrelevant. You now must either be a Irish cultured or personally hold land in Ireland to see it (in addition to being Celtic Pagan or Druidic).

2015-02-27 v0.36.1 "Adonis"
-------------------------
General:
- New cover image for Steam Workshop.
- Tags added for Steam Workshop.
- Pagan County Conquest can now target counties up to one sea zone away. Celts in Britain should have an easier time hoping the Irish Sea or the Channel.
- Added missing OR in the paganify event that meant that those cultures who should have gone Tengri, didn't.
- Added localization for the new CoA types, so they don't show as coa_plain_celtic, etc., in the Ruler Designer.
- Updated the Gone Pagan decision(s) to the latest version available from CK2+.
-- Characters that convert via the Gone Pagan decisions will gain the Zealous trait, which should make it less likely for them to instantly convert when faced with a Holy War.

Celtic Paganism:
- Children who are already Druids, or are training to become Druids, will not ask their parent to send them for Druid training.
- The Sacred Dogs modifier should now work as intended, giving a garrison growth bonus.
- The Sacred Lake tax bonus has been reduced from the insane 80% to the, likely intended, 8%.
- Your daughter will no longer be referred to as a "madman" if she comes back from her Druid training insane.
- Druidic (reformed celtic) can no longer be selected in Ruler Designer.
- Added missing gfx for wolf trait.
- Fixed localization for the Sons of Gwydion formation event ("restless sons of Emperor." -> "restless sons of the Empire.")
- Fixed bug in "Child returns from druidic training with a strange child" event that made the ruler the parent of the strange child, instead of the returning druid.
- Fixed some localization that was gender specific. These will continue to crop up as we find them.
- The temple of Mellifont (Dublin holy site) should exist in all starts now.

Hellenic:
- Epic Blood traits no longer selectable in Ruler Designer. Its not finished yet, stop asking!

Promethean Paganism:
- Prometheans can now hire women to any councilor position, just like the other <feminist = yes> religions, as intended.

General:
- Pagan religions now use random flags for all title tiers
- Added a paganify decision available on startup, before unpausing the game
- Fixed adopt feudalism and republicanism decisions
- Removed FRENCH, SPANISH and GERMAN used as localization for non-translated keys: the game now properly defaults to English when a key is not translated in another language and playing in that language. This allows to play with partially translated mod(s), yet being able to see something useful for the keys missing translations.

- Fixed encoding of some files
- Fixed ALL validation errors from non-vanilla files

- Created decision to recreate the pontificate and pontifex_restored religion modifier
- Created titan_pagan and promethean_pagan heresies
-- Added titan 'Hold Thysia' decision 
-- Titan Cultists are barbaric, it is an unreformed faith that cannot reform, and has many simalarities to other such religions
-- Promethean pagans can no longer use, or are subject to, subjugation
-- Promethean pagans can no longer use county conquest
-- Prometheans are pre-reformed and have a creatable head of religion, the Scholarch of the First Academy
- Rebalanced the Roman Legion retinue to match vanilla sizes (250)
- Fixed hellenic_county_liberation CB discrepancy (using CB on other rulers under same liege causes the CB to end inconclusively): CB cannot be used on same realm characters.
- Fixed restore_roman_empire decision having no effect
- Allowed "Studied the Classics" revival event chain to fire after year 1066 (with increased MTTH) and added religious sympathy trait.

-- Based chance of courtier converting changed to 15%.
-- Christians and Muslims far more likely to convert than jews or indians.

Egyptian Paganism:

2015-01-31 v0.35.4 "Minor Fixes"
--------------------------------
- Celtic Pagans can now hire Celtic pagan women to any councilor position, assuming they otherwise qualify. Note: Celtic Pagans and Druidic's require their Chancellor and Chaplain to have the either the Druid, Bad Druid, or Poet trait. The Invite Druid to Court decision fires an event 3 days after you make the decision. So long as you don't have a Court Druid (minor title) you can make the decision. Also, all Celtic Pagan/Druidic Theocracies are automatically given the Druid trait.
- Fixed religion description localization for Celtic Pagan, Druidic, and Hellenic.


2015-01-21 v0.35.3 "Error Free!"
--------------------------------
According to the Validator anyway!
- Fixed CTD when conquering certain counties as a Celtic Pagan.
- Added localization for several dozen titles, modifiers, and events.
- Added new god names for Kemetic pagans.
- You should now be able to (successfully) look up to your favorite hero of the Trojan War as a hellenic pagan. Unless your favorite hero isn't Achilles, Odysseus, Nestor, Hector, Aeneas, or Paris. Minor thematically appropriate benefits incurred.
- Removed defunct compatabilty files to reduce confusion and clutter. They'll make a triumphant return, I promise!
- The Arch Druid can now call Great Holy Wars.
- Notification event that the Wolf Tails have founded is no longer being handed to a province


2015-01-15 v0.35.2 "Maintenance Release"
----------------------------------------
- Fixes an event id collision between the Wolf Tails events and three of the Celtic Sacred Symbols events.
 
 
2015-01-13 v0.35.1 "Religious Icons and Other Fixes"
----------------------------------------------------
- Religious Icons should be working again.
- The Sons of Gwydion now have a flag (a copy of the Red Dragons flag, for now). You'll have to delete your flag cache. There are tutorials online for this.
- Fixed syntax errors in a handful of events, traits, and modifiers have been fixed.


2015-01-12 v0.35 "Second Life"
------------------------------
This release marks a second life for Ancient Religions. With superskierpat having moved on to higher education, others take up the charge of maintaining and expanding the work of their predecessor.
Now, enough with the dramatics, time for details!

- Dozens of minor fixes from bad event triggers to localization. So many I can't even count them!
- A major reorganization of the files to make com-patches much easier in the future!
- Druidic pagans now have 2 holy orders and 2 mercenary companies!
- The Fianna have had several of their events fixed, expect a visit from the boisterous warriors if you are a Druid and a Gael (Irish or Scottish)! As before, they are created by the King (or Queen!) of Ireland, and can also be vassalized by said monarch, but it is costly. Young men in your realm may wish to join the Fianna, seeking fame and glory.
- The Sons of Gwydion. A mercenary company much like the Varangians, they are organized by, and serve, the Reformed Druidic Emperor of Prydain. They will have a slew of flavor events (most of which are cribbed from the Varangian events). Like the Fianna, your sons may wish to join the Sons of Gwydion.
- The Red Dragon Knights may be formed by any Reformed Druidic King level ruler. They operate like any other Holy Order. They can take donations, give out loans, and will occasionally ask druidic rulers in the de jure empires of Britain, Francia, Hispania, or Germania for permission to build a barony in their lands.
- Finally, The Wolf Tails are a mercenary company that will form spontaneously shortly after the first province converts to Druidic pagan (un-reformed). (The Wolf Tails and the Fianna will both convert when Celtic Paganism reforms.)
- Kemetic (Egyptian Pagan) has been ported over from CK2+ (thanks guys!) and is available if you have Ruler Designer. Currently there are no revival events implemented, but they are planned for v0.40!
- Refactored mod to use ACR_ prefix on txt/csv files and ACR sub-folders for assets, to ease-up mod integration
