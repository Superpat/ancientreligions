##### Decisions ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
prepare_titan_thysia;You begin preparations for the Thysia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan_thysia_begins;The priest readies his sickle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.0.desc;You have sent out summons to all of your vassals for the Great Thysia. Those that have been baptized, profess to follow the teachings of the Prophet, or follow the ways of Prometheus will have to offer gold to be exempted from this magnificent feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.0;I can hardly wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtitan.1;Summoned to Thysia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtitan.2;Exempted from Thysia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.1.desc;Your wise liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has summoned you and [From.GetHerHis] other vassals to a Thysia. There you will worship and give sacrifice to the titans before taking part in a great feast where you drink to their name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.1;I wouldn't miss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.2.desc;Your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], remains trapped in [From.GetHerHis] heathen ways, and now [From.GetSheHe] has summoned all of [From.GetHerHis] vassals to a Great Thysia where [From.GetSheHe] intends to give sacrifice to the Titans. Since you do not practise their heathen religion, you will be expected to contribute gold in order to be exempted from this ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.2;I suppose I have no choice in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.2;As [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] is my witness, I shan't pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtitan.3;Your payment is received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.3.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName], your vassal, is stubborn in [From.GetHerHis] ways and speaks only of the mercy of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], but [From.GetSheHe] has wisely decided to offer you some gold to be exempted from the Thysia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.3;As well [From.GetSheHe] should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtitan.36;Your refusal to pay is received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.36.desc;Despite having sworn you fealty, [From.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to offer gold in order to be exempted from the Thysia! According to [From.GetFirstName], [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] would not forgive [From.GetHerHim] if [From.GetSheHe] contributed as much as a single copper to a heathen festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.36;This insult will not be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.4.desc;The guests have arrived, and the time has come for the Thysia to begin! You gather outside the temple, and start by offering animals as sacrifice to the titans. While their meat is prepared for the feast that is to follow, the blood is sprinkled on statues of Kronos, Tethys, Hyperion, and the other titans, as well as on the worshippers themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.4;Now for the human sacrifice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.5.desc;The time has come for the Thysia held by [From.GetTitledFirstName] to begin! You gather outside the temple, and start by offering animals as sacrifice to the titans. While their meat is prepared for the feast that is to follow, the blood is sprinkled on statues of Kronos, Tethys, Hyperion and the other titans, as well as on the worshippers themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.6.desc;Although you have been told little, the noise from outside your dungeon is enough to make it clear that your captor, [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] is holding a thysia where [Root.Host.GetSheHe] will offer sacrifice in worship of the titans. Guards burst inside your cell and drag you away to the gallows outside the local temple... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.6;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.10.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. [From.GetSheHe] is chained to the great stone altar. A small yellow pool forms between [From.GetFirstName]'s legs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.10;Great Kronos, we offer you this sacrifice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.10;No, I have changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.11.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. As [From.GetFirstName] is chained to the great stone altar, [From.GetSheHe] steadies [From.GetHerselfHimself] and murmurs several passages that you recognize as being from the Christian holy book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.11;Where is your Blessed Virgin now, [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.11;No, perhaps this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.12.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. Your guards place [From.GetHerHim] on the alter and begin fastening the chains while [From.GetSheHe] murmurs a passage with closed eyes from the Mohammedan holy book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.12;Soon you shall meet your Prophet, friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.12;No, perhaps this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.13.desc;Your brother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is brought up from his dungeon and escorted to the temple. As he is chained to the great stone altar, he looks at you with pleading eyes. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]. There has to be some other way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.13;I'm afraid not. Do it, men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.13;No, I can't do this to my own brother...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.14.desc;Your sister, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged up from her dungeon and escorted to the temple. She looks up at you with tears streaming down her face as your guards lock her wrists in chains. Please, [Root.GetFirstName], she says with a trembling voice. Don't let them do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.14;There can be no turning back now. I'm sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.14;No... not my own sister...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.15.desc;The guards drag your father, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and escort him to the temple where they chain him to the altar. My [Root.GetSonDaughter], he croaks while looking at you. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.15;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.15;I can't do this to my own father...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.16.desc;Distant screaming can be heard as your guards drag your mother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from her dungeon. They bring her to the temple and as they place on the altar, she looks at you with pleading eyes. W-why would you do this to your own mother?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.16;Because I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.16;I... I wouldn't...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.17.desc;The guards fetch your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and lead him to the temple. There he is chained to the great stone altar. Before you plunge the sacrificial dagger into his heart, your son looks at you with tearful eyes. Please don't, [Root.GetFatherMother]... please don't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.17;The Titans demand blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.17;I can't do this... not to my own boy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.18.desc;Your daughter, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is pulled from her dungeon and brought to the temple by your guards. As they chain her to the altar, she looks at you with a desperate yet piercing glare. Is this really what you have been reduced to, [Root.GetFatherMother]? To do this... against your own daughter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.18;You have left me with little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.18;No, send her back... not to my girl...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.19.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought from your dungeons by the guards and placed on the altar in front of the temple. As they lock the manacles around [From.GetHerHis] wrists, [From.GetFirstName] cries out to you. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]! We are family and of the same blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.19;Yes, and that only proves my devotion to Kronos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.19;It is true... [From.GetSheHe] is kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.20.desc;Your spouse, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged to the altar in front of the temple and your guards fix the chains to [From.GetHerHis] wrists. In a last desperate effort to save  [From.GetHerselfHimself], [From.GetFirstName] calls out to you for mercy. I have always loved you, [Root.GetFirstName]... and I always will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.20;Forgive me then, my love, but this is how it must be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.20;No, this is too much... I can't permit it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.21.desc;From deep within your dungeons, your guards bring out [From.GetTitledFirstName], your Olympian prisoner. As they drag [From.GetHerHim] to the front of the temple and place them [From.GetHerHim] on the altar, the Olympian prays to [From.GetHerHis] usurper gods and stares at you defiantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.21;Let us show you how a proper sacrifice is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.21;No, this brave Olympian shall live to see another day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.22.desc;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is dragged to the great altar in front of the temple and chained to the blood stained stone. Soon [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s body hangs limply on the cold stones, steam rising from [From.GetHerHis] blood pooling on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.22;This should please the titans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.23.desc;Your liege's guards have brought a Christian, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the altar in front of the temple. As the chains are locked around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] wrists, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] continues to prattle on about the Holy Spirit and how we shall all suffer in Hell for our sins... but soon [FromFrom.GetSheHe] speaks no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.24.desc;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a Mohammedan from your liege's dungeons, has been brought to the temple and will now be sacrificed to the titans. As [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is chained to the great altar, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] quotes a passage from their holy book right up until the knife plunges into their heart and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] blood pours onto the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.25.desc;Your liege has told [From.GetHerHis] men to fetch [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own brother, from the dungeons. [From.GetFirstName] betrays no emotion as [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is brought up to the altar in front of the temple, and soon his limp body can be seen slumped on the altar, drained of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.26.desc;It seems your liege has decided to sacrifice [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own sister, to the titans. She has been brought out from [From.GetFirstName]'s dark dungeons, and while she squints her eyes in the unfamiliar daylight, the guards chain her to the altar. Moments later her eyes are forever dead and listless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.27.desc;To your surprise, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] orders [FromFrom.GetHerHis] guards to bring out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] - [FromFrom.GetHerHis] own father. He is brought to the altar in front of the temple, and soon he joins the others bleeding on the altar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.28.desc;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], the mother of your liege, appears at the temple flanked by guards, and to your surprise they escort her right up to the altar. She pleads in vain with [From.GetTitledFirstName], but [From.GetSheHe] will not be moved. Within moments, she lies next to the other offerings on the altar outside the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.29.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] marches [From.GetTitledHerHis] own son, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the altar outside the temple. He is to be the next sacrifice. All of his pleas fall on deaf ears, and moments later the guards chain him to the stone and he is made forever silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.30.desc;Those assembled at the Thysia gasp in surprise when [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], daughter of [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged up to the altar for the next sacrifice. She asks her [From.GetFatherMother] for mercy, but none is forthcoming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.31.desc;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a member of [From.GetFirstName]'s own extended family, is dragged from the dungeons and brought to the temple. Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that they are of the same blood, [From.GetFirstName] shows no mercy and the sacrifice takes place as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.32.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has apparently decided to sacrifice [From.GetHerHis] own spouse, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the titans, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has been brought in chains to the temple. Despite professing [FromFrom.GetHerHis] continued love, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to go ahead with the sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.33.desc;In honor of this Thysia, your liege produces an Olympian from deep within [From.GetHerHis] dungeons. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is brought to the temple for the sacrifice, and everyone agrees that this is a most worthy sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.34.desc;As you have no prisoners languishing in your dungeons that are suitable for sacrifice at the thysia, you are forced to make do with some randomly purchased thralls. They are brought to the great altar outside the temple, and soon their limp and lifeless bodies are drained of blood on the ancient stones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.34;It is better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.35.desc;As [From.GetTitledFirstName] had no prisoners languishing in [From.GetHerHis] dungeons that were suitable for sacrifice at the thysia, your liege was forced to make do with some randomly purchased thralls. They are brought to the great altar outside the temple, and soon their limp and lifeless bodies are drained of blood on the ancient stones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.35;Better than nothing, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtitan.37;Execution is stayed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.37.desc;As you stand trembling with the manacles around your wrists, [From.GetTitledFirstName] suddenly seems to have had a change of mind. The manacles are removed and you are brought back to the dungeon. It looks like you will live to see another day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.37;I... how... what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.40.desc;With the sacrifice over, the feast at the end of the thysia can now begin. The meat of the animals that were sacrificed has already been prepared, and there is plenty of wine to go around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.40;Let the celebrations begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.41;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.42.desc;The feast is over and with it the thysia. It will be at least nine years until you hold the next one, but as your vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.42;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.43.desc;The feast is over and with it the thysia. It will be at least nine years until your liege holds the next one, but as you and the other vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.50.desc;The wine and the spirits being served at the feast have gotten the better of you. You tried to be strong this time, and you did your best to stay away, but the pull was just too great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.50;*hic* Letsch drrink s-schome morr... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.51.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been drinking more and more since the feast began, and [From.GetSheHe] has now reached a point where [From.GetSheHe] he can no longer stand upright. Surrounded by empty tankards and singing at the top of [From.GetHerHis] lungs, you find [From.GetFirstName] lying on the table amidst the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.51;I think [From.GetSheHe] has had enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.51;*hic* I k-know thisch schong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.53.desc;Your mouth waters as servants place tray after tray of food on the table, and when the other guests engage in conversation, the only sounds coming from your corner are grunts and burps as you begin stuffing yourself. A sudden nausea sets in and you hurry towards the exit, but only make it as far as the lap of [From.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.53;UUAARGGHHHH...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtitan.54;Is vomited on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.54.desc;Morsels of food and clean-picked bones fly everywhere from the direction of [From.GetTitledFirstName] as [From.GetSheHe] greedily stuffs [From.GetHerselfHimself] with the delicacies served at the table. Suddenly [From.GetHerHis] face turns a strange shade of green, and [From.GetSheHe] rushes towards the exit but only make it as far as your seat before [From.GetSheHe] starts retching [From.GetHerHis] stomach contents into your lap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.54;Those were my best trousers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.55.desc;Morsels of food and clean-picked bones fly everywhere from the direction of [From.GetTitledFirstName] as [From.GetSheHe] greedily stuffs [From.GetHerselfHimself] with the delicacies served at the table. Suddenly [From.GetHerHis] face turns a strange shade of green, and [From.GetSheHe] rushes towards the exit but only make it as far as [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] before [From.GetSheHe] starts retching [From.GetHerHis] stomach contents into poor [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s lap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.55;That could have been me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.56.desc;As you enjoy the feast, you are struck by the warmth and kindness of those sitting next to you at the table. In fact, it's getting just a little too warm. You strip off your clothes and jump up on the table. Help, I'm on fire! you scream at the top of your lungs while waving your arms as the other bewildered guests look on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.56;Put me out, put me out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.57.desc;You are enjoying the feast when a shrill scream from the other end of the room suddenly draws your attention. Stark naked, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is running around on the table waving [From.GetHerHis] arms while screaming that [From.GetSheHe] is on fire. You groan and bury your face in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.57;That lunatic...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.57;So [From.GetSheHe] is! And... and so am I! AAAHHH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.58.desc;One of the serving girls has been eyeing you ever since you arrived at the feast, and now, fortified with mead, your hands grope at her body and she returns the favor. You pull off each other's clothes and give in to passion. Just as you join in her screams of pleasure, it dawns on you that you're doing this in full view of all the other stunned guests...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.58;Oops...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.58;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will not be happy about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.59.desc;You are conversing with another guest when loud screams of passion interrupt. In one corner of the room, in full view of everyone else, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is engaged in carnal pleasures with one of the serving girls. Both are completely naked, and only when they notice the stunned silence in the room do they seem to remember where they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.59;By [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.59;Haha, you old dog! Nicely done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCtitan.59;No! [From.GetFirstName], what have you done?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.61.desc;You have been seated next to [From.GetTitledFirstName] for the duration of the feast, and you have found [From.GetHerHim] to be a most agreeable person. There seems to be much you have in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.61;It would seem I have a new friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.64.desc;Your mind wanders as you sit at your table during the feast, when suddenly you lock eyes with [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Something about [From.GetHerHis] gaze seems to reach into your heart, and when [From.GetSheHe] steps outside for some fresh air, you quickly excuse yourself to join [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.64;I thought I was the only one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtitan.69;You are discovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.69.desc;You are locked in the embrace of your lover, and just as you kiss each other another guest wanders out of the feast hall and notices you. Though you immediately let go of each other, the damage is already done as the outraged guest rushes back inside to tell everyone what he saw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.69;It... it's not what it looks like!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.70.desc;With everything spinning from all the mead you drank, you stumble towards the exit to relieve yourself. As you step outside, you are treated to the sight of [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], embracing each other and kissing passionately. They immediately stop when they notice you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtitan.70;By [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]! You... you two were...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtitan.70;Oh, don't mind me. Carry on, friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.80.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. When [From.GetSheHe] sees the dried blood on the altar, [From.GetSheHe] pushes the nearest guard aside and makes a desperate run for it, but to no avail. Your men drag [From.GetHerHim] kicking and screaming back to the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.81.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. Even as the chains are placed around [From.GetHerHis] wrists, [From.GetFirstName] stares vacantly ahead without betraying any emotion whatsoever. It would seem [From.GetSheHe] has accepted [From.GetHerHis] fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
titan.82.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. As soon as [From.GetSheHe] spots you among those gathered nearby, [From.GetSheHe] hurls insults and spittle your way, continuing even as [From.GetSheHe] is bound to the bloody altar. The hatred in [From.GetHerHis] eyes cannot be mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
