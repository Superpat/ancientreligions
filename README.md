# Ancient Religions

> An ancient religions mod for CK2

This mod aims at recreating effectively dead religions in vanilla Crusader Kings 2.
If you want to include it in any publicly released mod, you need permission from the authors.
You also need to ask the authors noted in the Disclaimers section about their code.

## Features

For more info, check the [Ancient Religions page on ckiiwiki](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Ancient_Religions).

Current Religions:
 - Hellenic paganism
   - Titan Cult
   - Prometheanism
 - Celtic Druidism
 - Egyptian paganism
    Atenism
 
 There are currently no plans to add more religions, and we are not taking suggestions.

## Players

Installation steps:

1. __Important__: Delete your Ancient Religions folder, if you have one.
2. Extract the AncientReligions folder and the AncientReligions.mod file to your mod-folder (~\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod)
3. Enable the mod when launching the game
4. Have fun !

If you encounter any issues or are wondering about anything you can ask in the [Ancient Religions thread on the Paradox Forums](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/ancient-religions-reborn.829413/).
Do note that you have to register your copy of Crusader Kings II in order to view the thread.

## Developers & Testers

To run the mod from a Git local repository:
- Clone the repository to Git default location (for instance C:\Users\username\git\)
- Run [create_symbolic_links.bat](create_symbolic_links.bat) to create symbolic links from CK2 mod folder to the actual folders in your Git working directory
- Copy over the [AncientReligions.mod](AncientReligions.mod) file from Git folder to CKII mod folder (you will need to re-copy them occasionally when they change in Git)

For improved maintainability and compatibility with other mods, the following conventions are used:
- Mod files are prefixed with ACR_ (except for modified vanilla files).
- Mod gfx assets are stored under an ACR sub-folder (except for modified vanilla gfx).
- Changes are listed in a [Changelog](ACR_Changelog.txt).
- The [Validator](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?597480-The-Validator-Find-errors-quickly-and-with-minimal-pain!) is used to detect bugs, and is configured via [ValidatorSettings.txt](AncientReligions/ValidatorSettings.txt).
